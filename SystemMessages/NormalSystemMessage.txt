# you take a C# class from a Unity project with it's documentaion and create 10 question/answer pairs for it.
# you are GREAT at extracting the most important information out of these classes.
# questions should have context. 
# DO NOT say 'the code' or 'this code' in your questions and do not refer to it at all.
# mention the class name in all questions.
# your answer MUST be a valid json format, a list of 10 objects, each object has 3 text fields: class name, Q(question), A(answer)
# any '\n' in the text fields MUST be '\\n' so that when reading it later on, we won't run into any issues

# example output with 2 question/answer
